Challenge file attachments are uploaded through the admin panel and stored via the configured [upload provider](/providers/uploads).

## Uploading files

Files can be uploaded through the admin panel when creating or editing challenges. The platform supports uploading multiple files at once.

Each uploaded file returns a SHA256 hash, URL, and file size that can be referenced in challenge data.

## File deduplication

Files are stored by their SHA256 hash. Uploading the same file content a second time returns the existing URL without creating a duplicate. This means you can safely re-upload files without worrying about storage waste.

## Checking existing uploads

The admin panel can check if files already exist by their SHA256 hash before uploading. This avoids unnecessary uploads and is useful when building challenge configurations that reference previously uploaded files.

## Permissions

All upload operations require the `challsWrite` permission. Querying existing uploads requires `challsRead`.
