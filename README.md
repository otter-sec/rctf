rCTF is redpwnCTF's CTF platform. It is now developed and maintained by the [OtterSec](https://osec.io) team.

## Getting started

To get started with rCTF, visit the docs at [rctf.osec.io](https://rctf.osec.io/installation/).

If you need help with rCTF, [start a discussion](https://github.com/otter-sec/rctf/discussions).

## Deploying challenges with rCTF

rCTF itself does not handle challenge deployments.

Optionally, you can use [rCDS](https://github.com/redpwn/rcds) to deploy challenges. It is heavily integrated with rCTF.

## Contributing
